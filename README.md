This study applies machine learning techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior using the Online Retail dataset. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was employed to engineer customer features from transactional data. Three clustering algorithms—K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN—were implemented and compared. The results revealed four distinct customer segments, with K-Means producing the most interpretable clusters. Additional exploratory analysis uncovered seasonal trends, top products, and regional sales patterns. The findings demonstrate how data-driven segmentation can enhance marketing strategies, though ethical considerations around data privacy and responsible usage remain critical.
